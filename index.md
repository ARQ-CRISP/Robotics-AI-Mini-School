Join us at the Mile End Campus of Queen Mary University of London for the first pilot of the London Robotics & AI Summer School, jointly organised by Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) and University College London (UCL). This first edition will be a one-day event (i.e. a Mini-School), with presentations by academics of QMUL, UCL and Imperial College, followed by a short robotic hackathon in which you will be challenged to update the ROS code of a small robotic arm to pick as many objects as you can in the shortest possible time: can you beat our robot baseline?


**Programme** (this is a "Bring Your Own Laptop" event, if you want to code!)

* 8:00-9:30 Registration and Breakfast
* 9:30-10:00 Welcome and Introduction
* 10:00-10:40 A Robotic Sense of Touch (Dr Lorenzo Jamone, QMUL)
* 10:40-11:20 Computer Vision for Intelligent Robots (Dr Dimitrios Kanoulas, UCL)
* 11:20-12:00 Imitation Learning for Robot Control (Dr Edward Johns, IC)
* 12:00-13:00 Lunch and informal Students-Speakers discussion
* 13:00-15:30 Mini-Hackathon (part #1): code my robot (can you beat the baseline?)
* 15:30-16:00 Coffee Break
* 16:00-17:30 Mini-Hackathon (part #2): presentation of results and closing
* 17:30-19:00 Drinks reception
